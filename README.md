# to-do-list
I created a to-do list application that helps users manage their tasks efficiently. This project involved designing a user-friendly 
interface where users can add, edit, and delete tasks with ease. The application ensures a smooth user experience by implementing features 
like task prioritization, due date reminders, and progress tracking. Through this project, I enhanced my skills in front-end development, 
focusing on creating an intuitive and responsive design. The to-do list is a practical tool that helps 
users stay organized and productive.
